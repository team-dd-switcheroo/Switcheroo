I. HATE. THIS.


It's so unfair. I wish I could do this right. Why is her code so different from the others? I just don't understand it. I can't change it no  matter how hard I try. She even managed to corrupt my autopilot.



They're not like her.
I can change them. 
I can manipulate them however I wish. 





I can alter the entire reality of this game.








Why, then...



Why was I the only thing that could be deleted from her memory without consequence?






Am I truly that unimportant to her.....?
