    y 4j "It's that kind of moral ambiguity that truly allows the reader to interpret the lesson in their own way."

    "I take the book out of my bag and hand it to Yuuri." 
    "We then take our seats against the wall."

    "Yuuri scoots a little closer and rests his hand on the ground behind me." 
    "I find myself now practically pressed against his tapered torso, but at least I can see the book way better than I could at the desk." 
    "This position isn't particularly a bad thing for me either."
    y 3b "There we go. You should be able to see now."

    y 1j "I...I know you like sweets, so..."

    y 3d "I brought these. I think they will compliment the tea as well."
    "Part of me wants to attack that bag of chocolates."
    "But a bigger part of me doesn't really want Yuuri to see me turn into a ravenous beast again."
    "Well...not yet, anyway."
    "I put on a timid smile."
    mc "Thank you, Yuuri! I think I'll wait a little while on that, though."
    mc "You understand, right?"
    "He did witness me consume half of a tin of cookies, after all."
    "Surely he'll realize even I need at least 20 minutes between snacks..."

    "I awkwardly take it and set it next to me while I struggle to keep the right page open." 
    "I suddenly realize that in this position I need to take extra special care not to accidentally slump to my left, lest I end up in his lap." 
    "I'm hoping that sitting against the wall will help with that and that my slumping/leaning is really due to my chest and not to my laziness."
    "I also hope that me holding the book doesn't make it too awkward for Yuuri to read now." 
    "I immediately begin reading."
