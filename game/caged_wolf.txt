A caged wolf is an axious beast.
She'll pace restlessly.
She'll rip at the bars.
She'll dig at the concrete beneath her feet.
For weeks or even months, the wolf will pace and rip and dig.
A relentless and tenacious beast is the wolf.
But after a time, the wolf begins to relax.
She ceases her insesent pacing to lie down a while.
She sits with her face between the bars, quietly observing her surroundings.
Yes, she will occassionally rise and pace wildly.
At this point, she realizes it's futile.
She accepts that she's never going to be free again.




Until the day she's determined to be free.
Then she'll rip that cage apart.
And come looking for me.





I'm the one who put her in there, after all...
