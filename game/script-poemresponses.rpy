    m 6ab "If you say so."
    mc "What do you know about Satori's writing style anyway?"
    mc "I thought this was out first time sharing poems."
    m 6i "That may be true, but it doesn't take a genius to know what style each of us are bound to like if you just pay attention."

    m 3d "I see his writing having a really gentle feel to it..."
